      <p>I am currently a final year software engineering student and bootcamp graduate. <br/> I have a strong passion for software and I am eager to learn as much as I can.
      <br/> While studying at university I have gained valuable experience in all aspects of technology. <br/> I started with basic web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript,
       then intro programming with ruby. <br/> I also enjoyed learning about basic cybersecurity and networking fundamentals. <br/>
      With more of a focus on Web Dev and software engineering I moved on to writing SQL code and developing complex <br/>
       relational databases. As my knowledge furthered I began focusing on object orientated programming with c#. <br/>
        At this point I went on a journey myself and began learning how to create secure and scalable <br/> web applications, leading me to learn how to use powerful frameworks such as Reactjs, Ruby on Rails, <br/>
        Asp.Net and Angular. This gave me the confidence in leading my teams in university to work <br/> in an agile team environment to deliver complex software.

         <br/><br/><br/>

        I am entremely passionate about software and I continuously strive to increase my coding abilities <br/>and learn new technologies
         to futher my skills as a developer.  <br/>
